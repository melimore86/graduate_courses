####Plan
Data Management Plan
•	Creating and continuing to 
•	Data management checklist for each sample data
Data Stewardship Roles and Responsibilities
•	Having rules for each user on what data they can enter as well as edit

Acquire
Methods of acquiring data, to this project
•	Field measurements from sampling (follow guidelines developed earlier with Dan and Robert, human, sensor, etc.)
•	Data from other cooperators

Data and File format standards
•	Standardization for all data collected, date, coordinates, measurements
•	Creating a data dictionary

Organize Files/ Data
•	Determine the format of each data set collected/entered
•	Determine the storage requirement of each type of data set
•	Use logical naming conventions and readmes for clarification 

####Process
Workflow capture
•	Describe technology and software needed for data processing
•	List all inputs and output
o	If an R code will output a .csv
•	Documenting the process with steps
•	Creating best practices, a possible checklist
•	Some mentions in USGS about version control, publishing data and analysis to be public 
Analyze
Data Analysis 
•	Statistical analysis, i.e avg daily mean for salinity
•	Visualizations for cleaned and analyzed data
•	Spatial analysis of cooperator data and collected salinity data, and shoreline changes
•	Analysis Documentation 
o	Notes in scripts
o	Readmes
o	Documenting steps in analysis

Preserve
Repositories
•	Storing final data and analysis within repositories, Github
Archiving 
•	Long-term storage, T Drive

Publish/Share
Data Release
•	Email releases for major Github repository publishes

o	This site was the model for the data sharing plan I developed for the Lone Cabbage project.  
Another example is here: https://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/BIODMP_Guidance.pdf

•	Discuss limitations.
•	Discuss how other data types can benefit from the data management. 
•	Discuss advantages of the approach
o	can be used by many people not necessarily IT
o	Maybe create a test repository
