# Problem 1 Shrub Volume Data Basics

# Question 2
# Use str() to show the structure of the data frame and its individual columns

# Problem 2
# Shrub Volume Aggregation

# This code calculates the average height of a plant at each site:
by_site <- group_by(shrub, site)

# Question 1
# Modify the code to calculate and print the average height of a plant in each experiment.

# Going to modify this in 1 line, instead of breaking it up

# Problem 4 Portal Data Manipulation
sur<- read.csv ("assignment_3/surveys.csv", header= T, stringsAsFactors = F)

# Question 1 
# Use select() to create a new data frame with just the year, month, day, and species_id columns in that order.

survey_df<- sur %>%
  select(year, month,day,species_id)
survey_df

# Question 2
# Use mutate(), select(), and na.omit() to create a new data frame with the year, species_id, and weight in kilograms of each individual, with no null weights.

survey_mu_na<- sur %>%
  mutate(wgt_kg=(weight/1000)) %>%
  select(year,species_id, wgt_kg) %>%
  na.omit(weight)
survey_mu_na
  
# Question 3 
# Use the filter() function to get all of the rows in the data frame for the species ID SH

survey_filter<- sur %>%
  filter(species_id == "SH")
survey_filter


# Question 4
# Use the group_by() and summarize() functions to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID.

survey_group<- sur %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarize(count=n())
survey_group

# Question 5
# Use the group_by() and summarize() functions to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID in each year.

survey_year_group<- sur %>%
  group_by(species_id, year) %>%
  summarize(count=n())
survey_year_group

# Question 6
# Use the filter(), group_by(), and summarize() functions to get the mean mass of species DO in each year.

survey_filter_group_summ<- sur %>%
  filter(species_id == "DO") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_mass= mean(weight)) %>%
  na.omit(weight) # added this because there are many NAs within the species_id == "DO", might be less NAs in weight for other species
survey_filter_group_summ

#This will not generate the same table as the output in the Data Carpentry Assignment 3, but it is correct for the species_id == "DO"

# Problem 5 Fix the Code 

# Question 1
# Fix the errors in the code so that it does what itâ€™s supposed to
# The following code is supposed to import the shrub volume data and calculate the average shrub volume for each site and, separately, for each experiment

shrub_5<- read.csv("assignment_3/shrub-volume-data.csv", header=T, stringsAsFactors = F)

shrub_5 %>%
  mutate(volume = length * width * height) %>%

  summarize(mean_volume = mean(volume))


shrub_5 %>%
  mutate(volume = length * width * height) %>%
  group_by(experiment) %>%
  summarize(mean_volume = mean(volume))


# Question 2
# Add a comment to the top of the code explaining what it does

# This code is importing the .csv, and notifiying R that there is a header, and not to have any factors in the data when importing 
shrub_5<- read.csv("assignment_3/shrub-volume-data.csv", header=T, stringsAsFactors = F)

# This code will calculate the volume from the length, width, and height, grouping by site, and them summarizing the mean volume 
shrub_5 %>%
  mutate(volume = length * width * height) %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(mean_volume = mean(volume))

# This code will calculate the volume from the length, width, and height, grouping by experiment, and them summarizing the mean volume

# Importing data

# Question 1
# Use inner_join() to create a table that contains the information from both the surveys table and the species table.

sur_species <- inner_join(surveys, species, by = "species_id")
sur_species

# Question 2
# Use inner_join() twice to create a table that contains the information from all three tables.

sur_spe_plot<- inner_join(sur_species, plots, by = "plot_id")
sur_spe_plot

# Question 3
# Use inner_join() and filter() to get a data frame with the information from the surveys and plots tables where the plot_type is Control.

sur_plot<- inner_join(surveys, plots, by = "plot_id")
sur_plot

sur_plot_fil <- sur_plot %>%
  filter(plot_type == "Control")
sur_plot_fil

# Question 4
# We want to do an analysis comparing the size of individuals on the Control plots to the Long-term Krat Exclosures. Create a data frame with the year, genus, species, weight and plot_type for all cases where the plot type is either Control or Long-term Krat Exclosure. Only include cases where Taxa is Rodent. Remove any records where the weight is missing.


sur_spe_plot_4 <- sur_spe_plot %>%
  select(year, genus, species, weight, plot_type) %>%
  filter(plot_type == "Control"| plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure") %>%
