joiner between station name and station coordinates, with the start and end

determining the centroid with the coordinates of the transect replicate, needs to talk with joe about the primary key, and the foreign key, needs to match the ESRI products so that it works, however ESRI doesn't accept every primary key frames


will combine with the tiles, that the transect and the wq data

naming conventions for the wild bars, create new names for it, but with the same kind of naming convetions, LC23 N for example, have the spatial defined 

Maybe having a tripID, where it can gave a code for accertain trip

make the cooperator data private

ESRI summer institute, to look it up and apply, workshops 


Check on the start time and end time, and see if there the best way to have the time on there, create some code with lubridate and with zoo
