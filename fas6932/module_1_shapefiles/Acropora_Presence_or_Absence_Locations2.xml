            <abstract>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) have embarked upon a collaborative effort to produce an online tool to allow for the open dissemination of Acropora-related datasets. An ArcGIS geodatabase has been built with the purpose of effective and accurate depiction of benthic data related to Acropora palmataand A. cervicornis. The geodatabase has been populated with significant multi-agency data from federal, state, university and non-government organizations. These agencies include NOAA, National Park Service, FWC, University of Miami, Univeristy of North Carolina - Wilmington, National Coral Reef Institute and The Nature Conservancy. All datasets include Acropora presence/absence and latitudinal /longitudinal coordinates at the minimum. This project was funded by award NA1ONMF4720029 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Department of Commerce.</abstract>
            <purpose>To record and display the reported sightings of Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.</supplinf>
